  <h1>Oooops... nobody was there.</h1>
  Sorry, but the first round extraction found no interesting places at all.
  <p>
    This could mean any of the following:
    <ul>
        <li>All visits have been dropped by filters.</li>
        <li>The data source is not available.</li>
        <li>An internal error occured.</li>
    </ul>
    or, in other words: Either nothing interesting has happened yet, or something
    is broken.
  </p>
  The extractor will keep running until an interesting visit is found...
