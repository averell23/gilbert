<h1>Building the package</h1>
       This section explains how to compile and installed the included applications. 
   You should be aware that this is <b>not</b> a finalised application: Be 
 prepared to get your hands dirty.             
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
             
<p> To use all of the Perl scripts, you need: </p>
           
<ul>
       <li>Perl 5.6.0 or newer (5.6.0 used for testing)</li>
       <li>LWP::UserAgent Module</li>
       <li>HTTP::Request and HTTP::Response (libwww) Modules</li>
       <li>DBI Module (Many scripts could do without</li>
       <li>DBD::mysql Module (Many scripts could do without</li>
       <li>XML::Writer Module</li>
       <li>XML::Parser Module (Probably not needed at all, requires the expat 
       toolkit)</li>
             
</ul>
       Note that if you want to go without the database modules (DBD and
DBI),   you'll need to disable or remove the functions in 
<span class="code">Utils.pm</span>
that depend on them. <span class="code">Utils.pm</span> should still be 
usable for some scripts (esp. <span class="code">weblog.pl</span>) 
without database support.        
<p> To use the Java applications you'll need: </p>
           
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se">JSDK 1.4.0 or newer</a>. 
  The software was developed using Version 
  1.4 of Java, and it <b>will not</b> work with previous (1.3 or older)  
  versions, since it uses the new regexp methods in the 
  <span class="code">String</span> class.</li>
  <li><a href="http://xml.apache.org/xerces2-j/">Xerces 2 XML Parser</a> 
  (jar file included in distribution)</li>
  <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J 1.2 or newer</a> 
  (jar file included in distribution)</li>
  <li><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/">Jakarta Ant 1.4.1 or newer</a> 
  (1.4.1 was used for testing). This
  is  optional,  but it <b>will</b> make your life easier, not only for this
  project ;-)</li>             
</ul>

If you're still having trouble compiling, try getting the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee">J2EE files</a>
 from  Sun.  Parts of the application rely on things like the Servlet API 
which is not  automatically installed with the JSDK (but may be installed 
with certain tools).<br/>

If you want to use the JSP application, you will also need a Servlet/JSP
server. Tomcat 4.0 was used during development, and you should be fine
with   that one. If  using a different server you should be aware that it
may provide   a different set of packages in the default 
<span class="code">CLASSPATH</span> (e.g. Tomcat provides Xerces and Log4J 
by default). This means you may have to tweak the build process to include
other <span class="code">.jar</span>s.

<p> 
The VisualBasic application mentioned in the paper was written by Albrecht
Schmidt. It <i>may</i> be included in the 
<span class="code">gilbert/thirdparty/</span> directory,
or will be available from Albrecht directly. Note that we don't have a
decent installer right now, so you'll most likely need to have Visual Studio
and VisualBasic installed to use it.<br/>

To JSP application is best displayed with a CSS capable Browser, like
Mozilla,  Netscape 7, IE 6 or Opera 6 (or newer, of course).  
</p>
                  
<h2>Compilation/Build</h2>
           
<p> Once you've installed everything and set your up your 
<span class="code">CLASSPATH, JAVA_HOME</span>
and  <span class="code">ANT_HOME</span> variables correctly, building 
the Java classes should be as
easy as  typing 
<div class="listing">
cd gilbert<br/>
ant frontend_war
</div>
This should compile all classes and create the
<span class="code">extractor.jar</span> and 
<span class="code">gilbert.war</span> files.
</p>
<p>
If you want to delete all those <span class="code">*.class</span> files
and build everything from scratch, go
<div class="listing">
ant extractor_clean
</div>
and the JavaDoc documentation is created by calling
<div class="listing">
ant extractor_doc
</div>
You can also do a
<div class="listing">
ant deploy_war
</div>
which will compile everything and the deploy the <span class="code">war</span>
file to your webapps directory. The directory can be configured in the <span
class="code">gilbert/extractor/build.properties</span> file.
</p>
           
<p> 
The <b>Perl scripts</b> should theoretically work out of the box, as
long as all necessary modules are available and they don't need
a mySQL connection. Just make sure that the paths to the 
<span class="code">Perl</span> binary and the modules are set correctly.
</p>
           
<h2>Installation</h2>
         
<p>
The best way to run the stand-alone Java applications is to include the
<span class="code">extractor.jar</span> in your
<span class="code">CLASSPATH</span>. However, you can also include the
directory <b>above</b> <span class="code">gilbert/</span> if you want to
use the classes directly.
</p>

<h3>Test Tools</h3>
<p>
<span class="code">gilbert/extractor/</span> contains a number of classes that
can be used to test different modules. These classes are named
<span class="code">*Test.class</span> and can be called directly, e.g.
<div class="listing">
Java gilbert.extractor.RefinerTest
</div>
Calling the test tools without parameters should print a brief usage
information.
</p>
<p>
Note that none of the test tools is very configurable, and if you want to
use them for your own modules you <b>will</b> have to hack the source.

<h3>GilGUI</h3>
<i>GilGUI</i> is a graphical user interface that allows you to test 
<i>gilbert</i> classes together. The GUI can be started by calling
<div class="listing">
java gilbert.ui.GilGUI
</div>
The interface should be more or less self-explanatory: You select the modules
that you wish to use and configure them. Note that the output windows work 
erratically at the moment, if at all. We recommend that you save the XML output
to a file and use log4j's <i>chainsaw</i> tool to view the log messages.
<p>
If you want to use your own classes together with the UI, you need to
change   
<span class="code">gilbert.ui.DataHandler.java</span> 
so that it the respective method
returns  your classes name. The easiest way is to just add a line with your
classes  name and hard code it like the default classes (although you could
also write  an interactive class browser ;-). The names of the classes are
the only thing  that is hard coded, and if your class is properly written
it should work with  the UI without further changes. 
</p>

<h3>Server log source</h3>
<p>
The JSP application, as well as the driver for the VisualBasic display, needs to
read XML encoded visitor information (usually your web server log file). The data
can be read from any URL, so you're free to write your own data source if you
like.
</p>
<p>
If you have a fairly standard setup, you can use the 
<span class="code">gilbert/logtools/cgi-bin/weblog.pl</span> CGI script
to convert your log file for you and make the data available. To install
the script:
<ul class="steps">
  <li>
    Copy <span class="code">gilbert/logtools/cgi-bin/weblog.pl</span>,
    <span class="code">gilbert/logtools/Utils.pm</span> and 
    <span class="code">gilbert/logtools/country-codes.txt</span>
    to your web server's CGI directory.
  </li>
  <li>Make sure that the prerequisites for running the Perl scripts are met.</li>
  <li>Edit <span class="code">weblog.pl</span>:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <span class="code">@local_net</span> should contain a list of the leftmost 
      numbers of all subnets you consider <i>local</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="code">@local_domain</span> should contain a list of the
      domain names you consider <i>local</i>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="code">$COUNTRY_CODES_NAME</span> should point to the
      file <span class="code">country-codes.txt</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <span class="code">$LOGFILE_MODE</span> should be the name of a
      valid log file mode. Valid log file modes are
      <span class="code">STANDARD</span> for standard (simple) log files,
      <span class="code">COMBINED</span> for Apache's combined log file
      format and <span class="code">ALBRECHT</span> for TeCO log files
      that use Albrecht Schmidt's home-grown format. If you need a
      different format, you can add it to the 
      <span class="code">split_logline</span> subroutine in 
      <span class="code">Utils.pm</span>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The first <span class="code">open()</span> statement in the script
      contains a call to <span class="code">tail</span>. Edit the command
      so that it prints the last <i>n</i> lines of your own web server
      log. Note that the log must be readable to the script.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>Connect to the script's URL to test it.</li>
  <li>Bear in mind that anyone who can access the script will
      be able to read your web server log!</li>
</ul>

<h3>Runtime configuration</h3>
<p>
Some runtime variables can be configured through the <span
class="code">gilbert/extractor/gilbert.properties</span> file. The properties
are:
<table class="directory">
  <tr>
    <td>gilbert.cacheTimeout</td>
    <td class="dirdesc">Timeout for cache entries (in seconds)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>gilbert.cacheCleanupInterval</td>
    <td class="dirdesc">Interval between cache cleanup runs (in hours)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>gilbert.proxyHost</td>
    <td class="dirdesc">Name of the proxy host to use. Leave empty or set to
    <i>disabled</i> to connect directly</td>
  </tr>
    <td>gilbert.proxyPort</td>
    <td class="dirdesc">Port for the proxy server (if on is used)</td>
  </tr>
    <td>gilbert.httpTimeout</td>
    <td class="dirdesc">Default timeout for HTTP operations (in milliseconds)</td>
  </tr>
</table>

       
<h3>JSP Application</h3>
<p>
We assume that you have the Tomcat web server/servlet engine installed - you
should be able to use the JSPs with any servlet engine, but the installation
procedure will vary.
</p>
<p>
The installation procedure for the JSP application is quite simple:
<ul class="steps">
  <li>
    Copy <span class="code">gilbert/gilbert.war</span> to 
    <span class="code">$tomcat_home/webapps/</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    (Re-)Start the Tomcat server. This will unpack and install
    the web application.
  </li>
  <li><b>Before</b> calling the application for the first time, you should
  configure it:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Edit <span class="code">webapps/gilbert/main.jsp</span>.
    The <span class="code">dataSource</span> property should be set
    to a data source URL (see above). You may also tweak the other
    properties, if you like.
    </li>
    <li>If you want to change the logging behaviour, edit
    <span class="code">log4j.properties</span>
    </li>
  </ul> 
  <li>The application can now be called at 
    <span class="code">http://[tomcat-URL]/gilbert/main.jsp</span>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you want to install a different version of the application, <b>stop</b>
    the Tomcat server and delete <span class="code">gilbert.war</span>
    and the <span class="code">gilbert/</span> directory.
  </li>
</ul>
                  
<h1>Programming Guide</h1>
<p>
<i>gilbert</i> is our Java-based implementation of the <i>DoorStep</i> system.
The step-through example in the <i>DoorStep</i> paper should give you a good
idea on how <i>gilbert</i> works, so read it first. 
</p>
<p>
Creating new <i>gilbert</i> modules should be reasonably simple. This document
highlights the main concepts and caveats that you need to know in order to
create a "clean" module that will run seamlessly with all the other parts of the
framework. You should also create the JavaDoc before you start, which contains
even more information about the individual classes (see above).
</p>
 
<h2>The <i>gilbert</i> architecture</h2>
<p>
The basic building blocks of the architecture are the 
<span class="code">Extractor</span>
and  <span class="code">Refiner</span> modules. Both read XML entities from an 
<span class="code">InputSource</span> and print their XML output to a
<span class="code">PrintStream</span>. Both inherit common functions from 
the <span class="code">AbstractTransmutor</span> class and have their own XML
handlers. All modules can be configured to run multi-threaded, since
multi threading support is already built into the base classes.
</p>
<p>
The chaining of multiple modules is usually handled by an
<span class="code">ExtractingChain</span> or a <span
class="code">RefinerChain</span> (although a module can also be used
independently). The <span class="code">Util</span> class contains (among other
things) methods for querying remote hosts that use <i>gilbert</i>'s internal
caching architecture.
</p>
<h3>Log4J</h3>
<p>
All <i>gilbert</i> classes print their debug and logging output through the
<i><a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/">Log4J</a></i> interface 
<i>Log4J</i> is a highly configurable logging tool from the Jakarta project, you
must import the <span class="code">org.apache.log4j.*</span> package to use it.
</p>
<p>
The <i>gilbert</i> tools (including the JSP application) read the <i>Log4J</i>
configuration from <span class="code">gilbert/extractor/log4j.properties</span>.
The syntax and options for that file are covered in the <i>Log4J</i>
documentation. Note that setting the logging level to <span
class="code">debug</span> will result in a <b>huge</b> amount of logging input.
</p>
<p>
The default <span class="code">log4j.properties</span> file already contains
configurations to log to a file, to the console or to Log4J's graphical log
viewer <i>Chainsaw</i>. (Note that Log4j will complain if it is configured to
connect to the <i>Chainsaw</i> viewer but cannot do so. Other configured
mechanisms will still work, though.
</p>
<p>
For you own programs to use the <i>Log4J</i> interface properly you must
configure it by inserting the following into your initialisation code:
<div class="listing">
PropertyConfigurator.configure("gilbert/extractor/log4j.properties");
</div>
This call only needs to be made <i>once</i> (i.e. before you start logging
anything), and there's no need to include into every class you write. However,
if you wish to log events from your own classes (which you should!), you must
get a logger for your class (this code should be put into your class' body (not
a method) to make the logger variable global):
<div class="listing">
protected static Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(this.getClass());
</div>
You can then log everything through the <span class="code">logger</span> object
- <b>do not</b> use <span class="code">System.*.println()</span> for anything!
Look up the <i>Log4J</i> documentation to learn more about how to use the
<i>Log4J</i> and the <span class="code">logger</span> object you've just
created.
</p>
<h3>Caching</h3>
Your <i>Extractor</i> or <i>Refiner</i> modules probably need to query a lot of
HTTP servers (e.g. to check if the server is alive, to check the document type
or parse the page). Since opening a HTTP connection is a fairly expensive
operation, <i>gilbert</i> tries to cache all requests. To benefit from
<i>gilbert</i>'s caching system, make <b>all</b> server request through the
<span class="code">Util</span> class. For example, if you need information
about the URL <span class="code">www.dahost.com/dadocument/</span>, do the
following:
<div class="listing">
SiteInfo urlInformation = Util.siteStatus("http://www.dahost.com/dadocument/");
</div>
The function will either return the <span class="code">SiteInfo</span> object
for <span class="code">http://www.dahost.com/dadocument/</span> from the cache
or create a new <span class="code">SiteInfo</span> object and store it in the
cache. Calling the <span class="code">siteStatus()</span> method will
<i>never</i> cause a HTTP connection to be made, this will only take place when
you query the <span class="code">SiteInfo</span> object: A call like
<div class="listing">
boolean urlLive = urlInformation.getAlive();
</div>
would the <span class="code">SiteInfo</span> object to connect to the URL and
return whether or not it is alive. If you call the <span
class="code">getAlive()</span> method a second time, the <span
class="code">SiteInfo</span> object returns it's internally cached value.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="code">SiteInfo</span> class provides a variety of useful
methods which allow you to query remote hosts. Each <span
class="code">SiteInfo</span> object handles exactly one URL, and it will query
that URL according to the following scheme:
<ul>
  <li>The object is created empty. No connection is made.</li>
  <li>When the object is queried for the first time, it contacts the URL.
      The information is stored in the object.</li>
  <li>All subsequent queries only retrieve the internally stored data. No
      further connections are made.</li>
  <li>The object will always issue a HTTP HEAD request first. If the request 
      can be answered using the HEAD request's results, no further connection is
      made.</li>
  <li>If necessary, the object issues a HTTP GET request to download the URL's 
      resource. If the URL is not alive, or if it serves a wrong resource type,
      the GET request will not be sent.</li>
  <li>If a request to the object can be answered using only the HEAD request,
      the GET request will not be made. If a subsequent request to the object
      needs the GET request, it will be made at that time.
</ul>
If the information you need cannot be retrieved by using <span
class="code">SiteInfo</span>'s methods, <b>it is highly recommended that you
extend the <span class="code">SiteInfo</span> class instead of making HTTP
connections yourself.</b>
</p>
<h3>Multi threading</h3>
<p>
Each <i>Extractor</i> or <i>Refiner</i> module will automatically spawn a new
thread for each URL that is processed. The number of threads is limited by the
classes internal variable <span class="code">maxHandlers</span>. If <span
class="code">maxHandlers</span> is set to 1 all operations will be executed
sequentially. To support multi threading, your module must lock the output stream
correctly (see the following chapter).
</p>
<p>
Since making a HTTP request always involves waiting for the network's response,
parallel request speed up the processing considerably - especially if timeouts
are involved (in the Lancaster network, multi threading gave a speedup of factor
ten to one hundred). 
</p>
<h2>Anatomy of a good <i>Extractor</i></h2>
<p>
This chapter gives you an overview on how the <span
class="code">Extractor</span> class works and what you need to do to make your
module compatible with the <i>gilbert</i> framework. Except for some slightly
different method names, the procedure is almost the same for <i>Refiner</i>
modules.
</p>
<p>
An <span class="code">Extractor</span> reads a data stream (which must be in the
<i>gilbert</i> XML format) from an URL and prints the (XML) results to a <span
class="code">PrintStream</class>. Using one of the existing <i>Extractors</i> is
pretty straightforward:
<div class="listing">
Extractor myExtractor = new StraightExtractor();<br/>
PrintStream someStream = x; // A stream for the output<br/>
// Sets the output<br/>
// Default is System.out<br/>
myExtractor.setOutputStream(someStream);<br/>
// Start extraction from "someURI"<br/>
myExtractor.extract("http://someURI");<br/>
</div>
When the <span class="code">extract()</span> method is called, the <span
class="code">Extractor</span> will read from the given URI, trying to parse it
as an XML document. The Extractor will print it's results to it's output stream
<span class="code">someStream</span>. The <span class="code">extract()</span>
method will block until the processing is complete and the last handling thread
has died.
</p>
<p>
The <span class="code">Extractor</span> calls a <span
class="code">VisitXMLHandler</span> to parse the input. Whenever the handler has
parsed a complete <i>url</i> tag, it will encode the information into a <span
class="code">Visit</span> object, and pass it to the <span
class="code">Extractor</span>'s <span class="code">handleVisit()</span> method.
The <span class="code">handleVisit</span> method is the hook for the modules: In
the simplest case a new module will only need to overwrite <span
class="code">handleVisit</span>. Inside the method the individual visit can be
analysed, and the output be printed. Thus, a simple <i>Extractor</i> module will
look like this:
<div class="listing">
import org.xml.sax.*;<br/>
import gilbert.extractor.*;<br/>
import java.util.*;<br/>
import org.apche.log4j.*;</br>
<br/>
public class MyExtractor extends Extractor {<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Create the logging object<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;protected Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(this.getClass());<br/>
<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public MyExtractor() {<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;super();<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Your own initialisation code, if needed<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// You need to take care of this yourself:<br/>

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Processing is done here<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
  <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public synchronized void extract(String uri) {<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extract(new InputSource(uri));<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;}<br/>
  <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public synchronized void extract(InputSource input) {<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// If you need per-run initialisation, do it here.<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// Since the super class doesn't clean up after <br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// a run, you should do:<br/>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;visitHash = new Hashtable();<br/>

</p>
<p>
The <span class="code">visitHash</span> is a <span class="code">Hashtable</span>
that contains the URLs of all visits the <span class="code">handleVisit</span>
method has already handled. If a visit's URL is contained in the <span
class="code">visitHash</span> it will automatically be skipped and <span
class="code">handleVisit</span> will not be called. <span
class="code">v</span>'s URL will automatically be added to the <span
class="code">visitHash</span>.

<h3>How it should look like</h3>
An <span class="code">Extractor</span> or <span class="code">Refiner</span>
module that is compatible with the
<i>gilbert</i> framework must have these properties:
<ul>
  <li>Be <i>Bean-like</i>: To ensure that it can be loaded and used with
      reflection, the module <b>must</b>
      provide a parameter-less constructor plus <span class="code">get</span> and
      <span class="code">set</span> methods for all relevant properties.
  </li>
  <li>The module <b>must</b> lock the <span
      class="code">outputStream</span> correctly if it wants to use
      multi threading. (See below)
  </li>
  <li>The module <b>must</b> always print an XML
      document in the correct format on it's output, unless it is a <span
      class="code">Refiner</span> that is an interface to the user display
      subsystem.
  <li>The module <b>should</b> always use the XML printing methods provided by
      <span class="code">AbstractTransmutor</span>. These methods will attempt
      to automatically convert special characters.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Locking the output stream</h3>
If the <span class="code">Extractor</span> is running multi-threaded, it will
spawn a new thread each time <span class="code">handleVisit()</span> is called.
To ensure that the output is correct, the code must be synchronised on the
<span class="code">outStream</span> for a <i>complete url tag</i> to be
written. This will look like:
<div class="listing">
synchronize (outStream) {<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// print the complete URL tag here, preferably<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;// using the methods from AbstractTransmutor<br/>
}<br/>
</div>
If you forget to synchronize on the output stream you may print <i>between</i>
other handler's output, resulting in a corrupted stream.
<h3>Examples</h3>
If you want to see how it all fits together, take a look at the classes that
come with the <i>gilbert</i> package. For an example for the <span
class="code">Extractor</span> module, see <span
class="code">gilbert/extractor/extractors/StraightExtractor.java</span>.

<h1>Known Issues</h1>
The software in this package is of <b>alpha</b> quality and <b>not</b> intended
for production use! There are a number of issues that need to be addressed in
future versions.
<ul>
<li><b>Webapp/URL selection:</b> The URL selection in <span
class="code">gilbert.extractor.jsp.ExtractorBean</span> is badly implemented (in
fact, the whole class is). The URL are randomly selected, without considering
the URLs rating. Also, <i>all</i> old URLs are discarded on each update, which
is probably not the best idea
</li>
<li><b>Caching:</b> Cache entries are only discarded if they are stale. There's
no limit to the number of cache entries, which could lead to memory problems.
Stale entries should not have a lifetime of longer than <span
class="code">gilbert.cacheCleanupInterval</span>, however.
</li>
<li><b>XML:</b> The XML connections between the different modules appear to be
unstable under various circumstance, and the error handling does not always
successfully deal with problems. This one needs thorough debugging and testing.
Probable reasons for the instabilities:
<ul>
<li><b>Parser classes:</b> The parser classes could still contain unnoticed bugs
that only show up under obscure circumstance, although they appeared stable
enough in tests. "Bugs" could also be exposed if the input format is changed.
</li>
<li><b>Special characters:</b> The XML parser is very touchy when encountering
"illegal" characters in the input. Unfortunately, they show up quite often in
log files. Always use <span
class="code">gilbert.extractor.AbstractTransmutor.printTag()</span>, which calls
<span class="code">gilbert.extractor.AbstractTransmutor.normalizeAndPrint()</span> 
to replace illegal characters
(<span class="code">AbstractTransmutor</span> is the superclass of both <span
class="code">Extractor</span> and <span class="code">Refiner</span>). If the XML
parser chokes on an illegal character, add it to <span
class="code">normalizeAndPrint()</span>.
</li>
<li><b>Threading:</b> Faulty synchronisation can lead to messed-up XML.</li>
<li><b>Thread communication:</b> The threads communicate through the classes
found in <span class="code">gilbert.io.*</span>. They probably need some more
testing.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
